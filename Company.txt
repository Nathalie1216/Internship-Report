The UPLB Information Technology Center (ITC) is the dedicated IT department of the 
University of the Philippines Los Baños. It was formed through the transfer of the Los Baños Computer Center (LBCC) 
from the Institute of Computer Science (ICS) to the Office of the Vice-Chancellor for Planning and Development (OVCPD) 
and merging it with Management Information Systems (MIS). The UPLB ITC stands as the newest unit under OVCPD.
